# Forfeiture Data

<PlaceholderTable json={data}/>

## Analysis

There are a number of metrics that may be useful when analyzing forfeiture data such as the total value 
of seized assets, types of assets seized, sources of seized assets, disposition of forfeited assets, and 
number of legal issues concerning forfeiture. While the total value and type of assets seized are 
easily-understood metrics, the purpose for reporting sources, disposition, and number of legal issues is 
less intuitive. Assessing the sources of forfeited assets would provide a window to understand any trends 
for the types of criminals that law enforcement is chasing, understanding the disposition of seized assets 
could help determine if forfeiture is being used to fund bonuses rather than public goods, and finally 
the number of legal challenges to forfeiture cases could indicate a trend in unconstitutional search and 
seizure of assets. There is no “norm” of forfeiture metrics as it is highly dependent upon many different 
internal and external factors, and there is no ground truth. However, an analysis of the location, types 
of crime, and disposition of assets together could lead to better understanding of how forfeiture is used.

## Explanation

Forfeiture is the process in which law enforcement seize the property, assets, and/or cash of 
people involved in criminal activity. It is not uncommon for forfeiture to be abused by individual 
police officers and/or departments. For example, departments may “police for profit,” in which they 
focus on seizing high value assets to generate revenue instead of eradicating the criminal activity 
that threatens public safety. State laws also allow assets to be seized without a proper conviction, 
and therefore insufficiently protect innocent individuals. The Institute of Justice awarded the state 
of Massachusetts with a grade of F for their forfeiture laws based on insufficient protections for 
innocent individuals, incentives for police to seize property for revenue, and the allowance of 
“probable cause” to seize property. By default, law enforcement agencies are not transparent about what 
liabilities have been seized and for what purposes. Therefore, it is important to point a spotlight on 
the forfeiture activities of police departments so that the public can gain insight into how law 
enforcement agencies are using this tool, and whether there are any trends that point to an abuse of 
power.
